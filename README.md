## How It Works

The game begins in a tutorial scene where you can follow guided steps or explore freely.  
Press `ESC` and select **Home** / use 'H' key to transition to a school hallway scene.  
Youâ€™ll find instructions on the right side, or encounter an interactable floating cube to proceed.

## Run the Executable

[Download the .exe here](https://shorturl.at/WCMWh)

After downloading:
1. Extract the folder (if zipped).
2. Open the folder and run Reality.exe.
3. The game will launch in full-screen mode.

Note: The UI is misaligned on certain resolutions due to scaling issues in WebGL/standalone builds.
I hope to fix this in the future and improve it.
